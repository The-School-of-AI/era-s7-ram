 # MNIST Classification Project Analysis and Implementation

## Target Selection and Justification

### Why 99.4% Test Accuracy?
Our analysis focused on achieving 99.4% test accuracy on MNIST with under 8.9k parameters based on:


### Validation of Target Selection
To validate our target choice, we:
- Analyzed that 99.4% represents strong performance while avoiding overfitting
- Reviewed literature showing diminishing returns beyond this accuracy level
- Considered that higher accuracy would likely require >10k parameters

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Architecture & Regularization
**Target:** Establish baseline model with proper regularization
**Results:** 98.65% test accuracy achieved
**Analysis:** Initial implementation focused on:
- Batch normalization after each convolution layer
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Basic architecture with ~8k parameters

### Step 2: Architecture Optimization
**Target:** Improve model capacity while staying under parameter budget
**Results:** 99.16% test accuracy achieved
**Analysis:** Enhanced architecture by:
- Adding residual connections
- Optimizing kernel sizes and channels
- Maintaining ~8.9k parameters through efficient design

### Step 3: Image Augmentation & Final Push
**Target:** Reach 99.4%+ accuracy through data augmentation
**Results:** 99.5% test accuracy achieved at epoch 15
**Analysis:** Final improvements via:
- Random rotation augmentation (22-45 degrees)
- Learning rate optimization
- GAP layer followed by 1x1 convolution

## Conclusion
We successfully achieved our target through systematic optimization:
- Final accuracy of 99.5% exceeds target while using only 8.9k parameters
- Model shows good generalization with minimal gap between train/test accuracy
- Architecture demonstrates efficient use of parameters through proper regularization and augmentation

Future recommendations:
- Explore additional augmentation techniques
- Investigate alternative architectures within parameter budget
- Consider knowledge distillation approaches
